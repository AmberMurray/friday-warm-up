because of default behavior of heroku, make sure your package.json has a start script

"scripts": {
"start": node app.js
}

git add .
git commit -m "comment"

heroku create // at the command line - it will generate a name for you
git remote -v to see the url // the "remote" part is the location
git push heroku master
heroku open // this will allow you top open your file in a browser


// to test the deployed url...
http POST https://longherokupathstringgoeshere.herokuapp.com/ phrase="test phrase"


// note: in your app.js, whenever you do a ".send" you can only have 1 parameter
// note: you can always add curly braces to make everything you want to send into an object
// heroku logs will show what's going on with their copy of your server
// node app.js (assuming app.js is your server file) will do ???
// whenever you hit enter or refresh in the browser, you are making a GET request
